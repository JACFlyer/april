## Description
APRIL stands for _Pregnancy_ _Resilience_ _Informatics_.

The onset of labor can be difficult to determine for a mom to be.  Knowing when to go to the hospital can be just as obscure.  At times a provider might send her home with instructions on when to return.  For a first-time mom, this can be scary and frustrating.

APRIL is a pregnancy home care product.  By downloading the app, and connecting APRIL tools to her smart device, the patient can record vital pregnancy information and share it with her provider.
