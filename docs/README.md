# Overview
_Applied Pregnancy Informatics_

The onset of labor can be difficult to determine for a mom to be.  Knowing the right time to go to
the hospital can make the difference between having a successful self-designed birth plan
and being admitted before planned.  At times, an ER labor and delivery provider might simply send
mom home, frustrated, and with instructions on when to return.  This is often a waste of time and
resources for both the hospital and the client.

It is the intention of this project to develop an evidenced based application that provides
accurate and safe coaching to the client regarding her stage of labor.  In so doing,
the application will promote the wellness of both the mother and child.

Using this product involves downloading the app to ones smart device (cell phone or tablet),
and linking external assessment tools to the program.  The entire _April Suite_ will be
implemented during a routine pre-natal visit at the office of the attending provider who will 
have access to the client's app profile for monitoring and response purposes. 





# Intended Users
* Pregnant women in antepartum period, and near early labor phase  
* Client spouses and support team members  
* OB/GYN and CNM medical providers  
* Community pregnancy support service providers

# External Services        
* Google GPS for 911 connection, [Bandwidth 911 Access](https://bandwidth.com/911).  This link will allow for seamless transition from a negative assessment to calling for help.  April is not dependent on this function.

* Fetal Heart Rate monitoring software and Wi-Fi enabled emitter, [Edan SDI Ultrasonic Pocket Doppler](https://fetaldoppler.net/fd340-fetal-doppler.html).  This API and device allows for the capture of the fetal heart rate.  This feature supports the critical project functionality of April.
 
* Cervical Camera software and Wi Fi enabled device, [SVAKOM Siime Inteligent Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Wireless-Vibrator-Waterproof-Massager/dp/B01DVQOLEA/ref=pd_day0_c_121_3/130-5634076-1338833?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01DVQOLEA&pd_rd_r=73fa6798-7050-40d9-8039-7dced9229204&pd_rd_w=EwUVf&pd_rd_wg=Bgb5y&pf_rd_p=47a9d55c-4dbb-48fe-a136-8e1abc72e8e6&pf_rd_r=F66E8CJ6654ZK5TQJQA5&psc=1&refRID=F66E8CJ6654ZK5TQJQA5
).  This API and device allow the condition of the cervix to be captured in real-time images.  The device supports the critical project functionality of April.  Future versions of the app will allow for AI interpretation of the database of cervical images in the attempt to develop a predictive algorhythm of visible cervical condition and time-to-delivery.

* Abdominal Ultrasound software and Wi Fi enabled transducer, [MobiSante](http://www.mobisante.com/).  This API and device will allow for the evaluation of residual amniotic fluid after the ROM.  Fetal presentation will also be observable by the provider while mom is yet at home.  The device supports advanced functionality of April.

* Considering and alternative corded Android capable camera fixed to vaginal suppository inserter.  This is a USB enabled Endoscope [Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Anykit-Megapixels-Inspection-Waterproof-Semi-Rigid/dp/B07NW4C7JG/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=vaginal+camera&qid=1582731129&sr=8-17) applied with an [Applicator](https://www.amazon.com/BoriCap-Suppository-Suppositories-Individually-Recommended/dp/B01M1NJOIF/ref=sr_1_24?keywords=vaginal+camera&qid=1582731694&sr=8-24)
This device is a more likely application for the immediate project yet a stretch goal.
