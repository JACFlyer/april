* Pregnant women at term and their spouses/partners  
As a first-time mom, I am really nervous about determining when labor starts  
and when I need to go to the hospital.  I need to know if I'm progressing  
in labor so I don't make a needless trip to the hospital.  



* Community pregnancy support service providers  
As a case manager for high-risk pregnant women, I need a reliable set of tools  
to help me perform antepartum assessments in the patients' home.
