* As a first-time mom, I am really nervous about knowing at what point during labor I need to go to the hospital.  I want to labor at home as long as possible.  My Certified Nurse Midwife gave me information about the April Suite.  I like the fact there are modules in the program that explain what I can expect to go through during labor.


* My wife and I have planned every detail of this pregnancy.  She wanted to flip a coin to decide which of us would carry the child but I thought that was too much.  We want to know what's going on at every phase of labor.  The April Suite will help us both feel confident we are making the right choices.


* The majority of my patients are professional women who lead very active lifestyles.  As their midwife, I consider it my duty to present them with safe and effective resources that promote wellness for both mom and baby.  The April Suite allows me to monitor my patient's early labor progress without being intrusive.  Babies have been born without medical help for centuries.  
My job is to ensure mom is well educated about the birthing process and warning signs of trouble.  She can then come to the hospital when she is ready or definitely needs to.


* As a doula in a community pregnancy services agency, I have a significant caseload of pregnant women with histories of life-trauma.  The April Suite offers them a sense of security and connectedness.
